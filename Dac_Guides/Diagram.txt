Paragraph: Diagram is a primary object representing a diagram.
Paragraph: Diagram represents a global diagram context.
Paragraph: You can create a diagram context with Diagram class. The first parameter of Diagram constructor will be used for output filename.
Code Block:
 from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2

with Diagram("Simple Diagram"):
    EC2("web")

Paragraph: And if you run the above script with below command,
Code Block:
 $ python diagram.py

Paragraph: It will generate an image file with single EC2 node drawn as simple_diagram.png on your working directory, and open that created image 
file immediately.
Paragraph: Diagrams can be also rendered directly inside the notebook as like this:
Code Block:
 from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2

with Diagram("Simple Diagram") as diag:
    EC2("web")
diag

Paragraph: You can specify the output file format with outformat parameter. Default is png.
Paragraph: (png, jpg, svg, pdf and dot) are allowed.
Code Block:
 from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2

with Diagram("Simple Diagram", outformat="jpg"):
    EC2("web")

Paragraph: The outformat parameter also support list to output all the defined output in one call.
Code Block:
 from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2

with Diagram("Simple Diagram Multi Output", outformat=["jpg", "png", "dot"]):
    EC2("web")

Paragraph: You can specify the output filename with filename parameter. The extension shouldn't be included, it's determined by the outformat parameter.
Code Block:
 from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2

with Diagram("Simple Diagram", filename="my_diagram"):
    EC2("web")

Paragraph: You can also disable the automatic file opening by setting the show parameter as false. Default is true.
Code Block:
 from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2

with Diagram("Simple Diagram", show=False):
    EC2("web")

Paragraph: It allows custom Graphviz dot attributes options.
Paragraph: graph_attr, node_attr and edge_attr are supported. Here is a reference link.
Code Block:
 from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2

graph_attr = {
    "fontsize": "45",
    "bgcolor": "transparent"
}

with Diagram("Simple Diagram", show=False, graph_attr=graph_attr):
    EC2("web")
